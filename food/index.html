            <h2>Laksa</h2>
            <p>Tangerang's famous laksa is a local favorite. It's a noodle dish in a creamy, spiced coconut broth, 
            usually with shrimp, chicken, or fish. The broth is savory with a hint of spice, making it super tasty. 
            It's often served with fresh basil, boiled egg slices, and crackers. Laksa is especially comforting on 
            cold or rainy days, giving a warm, delicious experience.</p>
